I have been orking a lot within a Linux VPS, using it as my quick workstation for note capture and journaling.  I wanted to also do some blog posting but didn't quite remember the steps to get Ruby >2.0 running for Github Pages.

```
# sudo apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install ruby2.2 ruby-dev
# sudo gem install bundler
```
