KWOLF(7)                Manager Behavior Manual                KWOLF(7)

NAME
    kwolf - servant leader, strategic innovator, and team enabler

SYNOPSIS
    kwolf [--urgent] [--non-urgent] [--feedback] [--whiteboard]
          [--decision <data> | --decision <solution>]
          [--growth] [--checkin] [--1on1] [--ping]

DESCRIPTION
    kwolf is a leadership utility designed to empower teams, align technical
    execution with vision, and produce real-world results through servant
    leadership and strategic innovation.

    The kwolf command is invoked in environments where trust, curiosity, and
    accountability are valued. Known for balancing technical depth with
    operational clarity, kwolf functions best when paired with transparency,
    autonomy, and a shared mission.

    Core attributes include:
      - People-first leadership grounded in mentorship and empathy
      - Community focus through service to organizations like Feed The Kids Columbus
        and the Ancient Order of Hibernians
      - Strategic innovation fueled by curiosity and a bias toward action
      - Deep technical engagement in secure SaaS and supply chain systems
      - Results-driven execution with measurable impact

OPTIONS
    --urgent
        For production issues, HR concerns, or pressing decisions:
        Call directly. If unavailable, follow up via text or Microsoft Teams.
        Email is a last resort for urgent matters.

    --non-urgent
        Use Teams messages to share ideas, updates, or casual check-ins.
        kwolf encourages whiteboard sessions or impromptu Teams calls when possible.

    --hours
        Core availability is 10:00 to 14:00 ET.
        Meetings are typically scheduled in the early morning or late afternoon.
        After-hours text messages are welcome when needed.

    --communication-style
        Prefers text or Teams messaging. Will escalate to calls or in-person
        discussions when more efficient. Meetings must include an agenda;
        brainstorming sessions should come with background context.

    --decision <data> | --decision <solution>
        Brings a solution, not just the problem. When unsure, provide data and
        viable options to enable collaborative decision-making.

    --feedback
        Delivered in the moment—honest, direct, and constructive.
        Expected to be a regular part of team growth.

    --1on1
        Held monthly with direct reports. Used to align goals, unblock progress,
        and ensure mutual clarity. kwolf values quick check-ins between 1:1s
        to maintain strong feedback loops.

    --mistake
        When mistakes occur, kwolf expects transparency, reflection, and
        documentation of lessons learned. Sharing failure is a team-wide learning
        opportunity—not a penalty.

    --growth
        Encourages curiosity, professional development, and team-driven innovation.
        Values stretch goals and self-directed improvement.

EXAMPLES
    kwolf --urgent
        → Phone call → Text → Teams message → [Email if all else fails]

    kwolf --non-urgent --whiteboard
        → Ping in Teams → Share idea → Set up a brainstorm session

    kwolf --decision data.csv --feedback
        → Bring options to discuss → Receive real-time feedback in conversation

FILES
    ~/.teams/kwolf          Preferred async channel
    ~/office/whiteboard     Optimal idea environment
    ~/.config/agenda.yaml   Required for meetings
