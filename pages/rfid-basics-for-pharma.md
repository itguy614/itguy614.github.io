**Advancing Traceability, Together**

Through my work, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to collaborate with many pharmaceutical manufacturersâ€”each with different levels of familiarity around **RFID**, **tagging technologies**, and **supply chain standards**. While some organizations have fully integrated RFID into their operations, others are just beginning to explore its potential.

The purpose of this collection of posts is to centralize foundational knowledge so that we can all work from the same starting point. By sharing concepts, standards, and best practices, we can help move the industry forwardâ€”together.

Below, youâ€™ll find a growing library of resources to support that mission:
